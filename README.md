# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  * This project analyzed the ride sharing data in different types of cities. The categories were urban, suburban and rural. The goal was to determine what changes the company could make to help maximize effiencies in these different city types. 
  
## Results
  * It was evident from the data that urban areas have way more traffic in ride sharing customers than rural areas. This is attributed to a greater population density. Urban areas have a greater ride count and driver count. With more customers, more drivers will be needed to meet the demand. Suburban areas fell in the middle of these two in terms of total rides and total drivers. With more drivers, the average fare per ride and per driver was smaller in urban areas than rural and suburban. Suburban areas were smaller than rural areas in this category. This could be due to customers travelling a shorter distance in urban areas and surburban areas vs rural areas. Further distances in a trip will results in higher fares. Furthermore, this drop in price could also be attributed to there being more drivers. With more drivers around, at times there may be more drivers than customers so when the supply is higher than the demand the price will decrease.

## Summary
 * Recommendations to the CEO:
  1. Make sure that urban cities are equipt with a sufficient amount of resources. These urban cities pull in the most revenue so it is vital to ensure that the customer base is happy in these types of cities. 
  2. Offer incentives for workers to drive in rural cities. It seems like the price per ride is fairly high which could bring in competitors with lower price offerings. If we were able to provide more drivers in rural and suburban areas, we could get the cost of the rides down and bring in more customers.
